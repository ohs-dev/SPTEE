In general, chances don’t look too good, but who knows how lucky you can get? In a word, that foreman worked in the chemo shop. The shitmost shit, see.

Several people saw them carrying large plastic barrels full of clean water to that location. Though I can't blame them for surviving any way they can, we need that water more than they do. Besides, the contamination issue will be solved very soon, so they won't be needing that water anyway. Acquiring this water will save many lives, so get out there and find where they store that water. We will all be indebted to you..."

Well, he was a young specialist, still an intern, but very enthusiastic. Planned to enroll in the Military Medical Academy in St. Petersburg. And in his safe, right there in the room, he kept a case with the particular new medical device. Issued to him by the employer. He tried to get out of town on his blue VAZ 2109 with Saint Petersburg plates. I don't know if he managed to get out or not, but as far as I have heard, he either got stuck near the gas station or apprehended by the military. In any case, I could really put that tool to good use. Come the darkest hour, and you might need it as well. Not that I wish for that to happen, don’t get me wrong, but...

This time you will have a way more serious enemy, they want you to decimate PMCs, but you should be kinda disguised as a Scav, so cover your face with a balaclava and put on their jacket, at least. And also, you are supposed to scare off the real Scavs - using a 12 gauge shotgun. It's almost as if they want to start WW3. Stirring shit up and making others turn on each other... Are you in?"

My people have run across some really interesting rooms in the health resort, which are, unfortunately, locked tight.

There are still many valuables left inside that can be salvaged and sold, for example, to American intelligence. I recommend searching for the trucks on the main road. Unfortunately, I don’t have the beacons right now, so you'll need to get them yourself."

There are at least three T-90 of which I am aware, and I am sure there are many  military devices remaining on them, such as laser rangefinders for example. Those models are not for export, and equipped with optics for domestic use. My customers would be very interested in comparing it to the samples owned by them. From the recon data, one of the tanks was left left on the small land bridge between the weather station and the hydroelectric power station, the other one must be somewhere near the north-west bunker at the Health Resort, and the last tank should be in the village on the dirt road at the collapsed tunnel. Mark the tanks with beacons, and my people will do the rest."

Two drones were shot down over the coast, now that getting to them has become possible, we can try to pull out the memory block from these. They should contain information about all movements at the beginning of the conflict. This information can make a good deal with my partners. Find their impact locations and bring me the memory disks. We have information about the estimated crash areas: the first one has to be somewhere near the local weather station near the port zone, the other one is near the bunker in the northwest."

We wouldn't be upset if not for the delicacy of the cargo, this time crates contained a little help not only for the people but also for the USEC company. You understand that we cannot allow casting a shadow on the United Nations' reputation. Find and wear UN uniform (UNTAR helmet, MF-UNTAR body armor) and teach local scum a lesson. Also, locate the spot where trucks were attacked, mark them with beacons, and bring me several MRE ration packs so I could present them as evidence, just in case. From the intelligence, one of those trucks has to somewhere in the Health Resort area, but there is no info about the other one. I think it's best to look somewhere near the port area, possibly at the construction site."

Despite the heavy bullet on this cartridge, it still has an average muzzle velocity relative to other cartridges of the same caliber, endowing it with a considerable stopping power effect, along with causing severe adverse effects on the target after impact at the cost of penetration capabilities."

Many people have tried to escape the current predicament, and some of them behaved like they were not human beings anymore, but for us, medics, nothing has changed. Our job is to save lives, no matter what the circumstances could be. When the shoreline tunnel collapsed, quite several survivors were injured. The ambulances were immediately dispatched to a distress call, but, well, I assume you know what has broken out there. Long story short, that’s where they stayed. I know that there were three or four vans, and the chances are high that most of the equipment and medicine is still inside... If you happen to find them, just mark them with beacons and my people will take care of the rest."

While researching the aftermath of the tunnel collapse, we’ve run across a TerraGroup executive's Geländewagen. It appears that part of the company’s top managers perished there while trying to evacuate. I’m aware that medical research was one of the top priorities for the company, and I'm almost sure that they had no time to evacuate its data and materials in time. Whatever they were doing, I think it can turn out to be very valuable, both for us and for medical science in general. It can earn us a ticket from Tarkov, even more than one. I’ve regularly met up with certain TerraGroup employees to discuss health care issues, so I'm pretty familiar with some of their works. One of my acquaintances, who, by the way, directly reported to that deceased Geländewagen management, used to live in the health resort building. Let me look it up... here it is, room 306. Search it for any documents that could possibly be left behind and bring them to me."

No wonder, though, the documents that you’ve managed to find are dedicated to some serious research in the field of Immunology, and from what we can understand, they have made some significant progress in that direction. Judging by the signature on the documents, the research was supervised by the head of the Medical Service of the health resort. Quite an elderly person, I’ve met him a couple of times on Health Care Worker Day. Although he was a venerable scholar he preferred the repose of the countryside over the bustle of laboratories and often spent time in the Woods, driving around in a white minivan. Witnessing the success, I believe, could have motivated him to start experimenting on humans, the first one most likely being himself, according to medical tradition. Scientists are always like that. Find his vehicle, and, if you also happen to find his blood samples, that would be great."

I was assisting an intern virologist with his thesis. Feels like it was yesterday, and at the same time so long ago. When the Internet was invented, it made it much easier to exchange information, even with colleagues from other countries. I miss this opportunity now to sift through the Scopus database, I am pretty sure that it has the answers to my questions, emerged after that blood sample research. Where could one possibly find access to the web now, you ask? To address this issue, I was advised to contact the one going by the name of Mechanic. As it turned out, he has access to the Internet, and it’s even relatively fast. I’ve asked him to look up the necessary articles for me. He asked for a small fee for his services, in the form of gunpowder, for whatever reason. It looks like he’s supplying someone with ammunition or something like that, but I am not really interested in that. Most importantly, he will provide the information we need. Find what he asks for, and leave it at the specified spot in the Factory. He asked to stash the cargo on the third floor in one of the locked doors. The door is quite fragile, as he said, so you can break it open without a key. The place is swarmed with Scavs in the daytime, so it’s best to do it at night."

Everyone is tired from the illusion of choice they were offered all this time, from having to work and buy either blue or red cigarettes. It’s happening everywhere, in every corner of the world. But here in Tarkov, we are honest with ourselves. We see it all in an already exaggerated way, without false values, when you don't just decide what laundry detergent is better at removing stains, but how to keep warm at night and where to find ammo to deal with the next lowlife who wants to kill you. Only in such an honest society, people show their true selves. What do you think? Okay, thanks for hearing me out. Some folks requested a fully packed M4.

I absolutely understand that this was impossible, but there was a sort of irrational fear inside me. Like when you're afraid of monsters under the bed as a child. I think such fears grow stronger the farther away you are from civilization. When you're among others, as part of the society, even if you find a monster under the bed, you can tell someone about it. But when you're alone in the dark every day, it doesn’t work that way. I’ll tell you what that \"monster\" was next time since the irregularities didn’t end with it. For example, someone’s jamming my signal, presumably from the Shoreline territory. It’s a hard trick to pull without powerful antennas. Try to look for satellite dishes, they most likely use something that looks similar. There should be at least two, about 400-450 meters away from each other."

After that, it would be extremely difficult to determine the source of the night sound. That’s how all those stories from newspapers are born, I assume. I can bypass the signal jammers by reconfiguring their frequency without raising suspicion of their owner as if things are still the same as they were. I need a few electronics for this and I think you can help me with this. The materials must be found silently so no one would get to know about what are we working on, only God knows, who might be involved in this.

They started treating each other better, started caring for nature, animals. An opinion was formed that principles of human duty go side by side with highly developed civilization and reason. Then, shall it turn out that the mind of the computer, which of course will very quickly evolve into an over-mind due to its high learning capabilities, will also be most humane at the same time?

Salvaging them all is impossible, but at least the cash can be taken. Should be especially plentiful in Goshan, and it's not that risky. Should be able to just grab the spoils and go, but there's one thing: they are all locked. So I have an offer for you about that: get me the key from the registers, and I’ll let you in on the cool schemes I’ve never shown to anybody. Brother to brother. Don't care where you get the key, you can just buy it from traders for all I care. But if you want an adventure, I know where the key could be. I knew one of the cashier clerks in Goshan, the guy wanted to leave the city on the bus during the conflict, and, well, got smoked at the gas station on Customs. Probably a good idea to check it out - what if he dropped the key somewhere on the seat? Well, go on, brother, don't let me down."

The value of art pieces by renowned artists grows every year. They are definitely talented, but the more you look at it, the more it seems that anything can be art. It can be a Rothko painting, a displaced urinal, or a bunch of garbage. However, in my opinion, the most amazing pieces of art are weapons, starting from the melee - which is already universally recognized as such and can be found in many museums - to an old AK or M4, which are beautiful as they are. But a weapon only transcends to true art when it becomes unique, one-of-a-kind, in the hands of someone who knows how to use it, who modifies it for his own needs, creating a masterpiece worthy of being displayed in the best of museums. Bring me one such masterpiece, an M4A1 with a KAC QDSS NT-4 (FDE) silencer, Alexander Arms MK10 rifle-length handguard, REAP-IR thermal scope, and a 60-round magazine.

He says the best way to test a person for his task is to check their skills with bolt-action rifles. He's a serious man, so I think he needs a fighter for something important. What do you think, can I recommend you? Try yourself in as the \"Tarkov Shooter\". if you pass all Sniper's tests, I’ll arrange you a contact with him. So, here's the first task he prepared: we need to test your accuracy with iron sights from a medium distance, let's say 40 meters."

Even messaged me to look up some decent fighters here in Tarkov. It seems the whole world has forgotten about our city... They only remember us when they need a hired gun, and while things are going good they prefer to not notice our situation at all. Anyway, I digress. Are you ready for the second task from Sniper? You have to shoot at heads and legs from the same distance, 40 meters."

It is not a rare case in combat, but you have to keep in mind that the enemy is a well-trained and well-prepared shooter. They are smart, will take up tricky positions, and try to deceive you. Even if they're not a professional military man, but a former gamekeeper or so. You need to \"tie down\" the enemy sniper, make them show themself - then, they're all yours. Well, these are recommendations I was asked to give you. Scavs just find rifles with scopes and climb up on the roofs or rocks, thinking they're actual snipers.

Such a situation can only be pulled in a society where people can combine both lies and betrayal and irrational, unexplainable self-sacrifice, which are more abundant in Tarkov than in any other place. Dostoevsky wrote about it, these people can live with the highest commitment to other people and at the same time be the best at killing. Sometimes we forget about this.

One feature is the dual recoil spring system that spreads out the recoil force of the .45 ACP round by lowering the peak force of the recoil pulse. It also has 3-dot tritium night sights, a 5-inch national match barrel, ambidextrous safety, a picatinny rail, and a desert tan Cerakote finish."

The other day, I sent a group of workers to collect supplies in the Cape Dalniy area, to the former USEC base of operations in the cottage area.

Unfortunately, the group has ceased all communication since yesterday. We suspect someone found out about our operation. Please, mercenary, find my people and, most importantly, their cargo."

According to our intelligence, after the initial conflict, the former base of your USEC comrades, in the cottage area at Cape Dalniy, was abandoned with a lot of valuable equipment and information that could sponsor the Blue Helmets operations. The only problem is that the entire territory is currently under the control of the Scavs, and I would like to get rid of them, or at least scare them out of this zone so that my people can extract all the necessary resources without combat. This is your task, my friend. Naturally, everything that you have just heard will remain strictly between us. I look forward to your report."

But do you know where there still might be something interesting? In the offices of the wastewater treatment plant. Yes, that facility was also under TerraGroup. What do I want to find? Fact is, I don't even know myself yet. To begin with, let's try to find out what exactly TerraGroup was doing there. Contaminated water, chemical dump ten times over normal? Anything can open up.

Plus, a sniper shoots everyone who comes near the lighthouse. We must somehow let them know that it's you, among all the other PMCs that are sniffing around there. So we'll put together a transponder for you. He will pick up the signal, give a sign to the sniper, and disable the mines. The path will be safe.

I know it's not easy, but it's worth it. When do I reflash the transponder? Buddy, you will reflash it. I don't have enough equipment here, but your Intelligence Center should have everything you need if you set it up right. I'll write down exactly what needs to be done. One more thing: the trader sends you the rules of your visit, so to speak. First: you can get to the lighthouse only while carrying the transponder, otherwise how will they distinguish you from the other PMCs? Second: do not run straight in there, make sure that the transponder worked. You will hear a beep, it means that the transponder is authorized, and you can move on. Well, good luck!

First of all, I've treated many people with somewhat familiar symptoms recently. Dilated pupils, tremors, confusion, and so on. Now secondly, my people who were evacuating the refugees from the city, noticed suspicious people near the containers in the Lighthouse territory. One of my men wanted to investigate and almost got killed. They definitely guard that place. Can you find it and place a camera overlooking the place? I'm not asking to tear down the place or eliminate those so-called cooks. Do you understand me? Do not risk your life for nothing. For now, I only need the recordings from the cameras."

They both lived in their apartment opposite the car dealership in the city, and for some reason stayed there after the evacuation. Don't know why, but that's not the point. While Sanych went to look for food, some bandits found their house, tied up the kid, and then him when he returned. They brought them both to this car shop and made them work for them, or else they'd both get put down like dogs. The leader's name is Kaban - everybody respects him there, Sanych said. At night the family managed to break out under fire and made it to the woods, where I found them. The son didn't survive - the wound was too severe.... Oh, right, to the point. If there's another bandit in town, you and I are the only ones who can act. Avenge the father's grief and make it so that it doesn't happen to anyone else ever again."

It's best to organize evacuation from the Emercom checkpoint: they have both the transport and the necessary equipment. At least, I hope so. However, I have rarely been in this part of the city, I don't know where exactly the station is. You need to find it. Then I'll send my men to check the area.\n\nOh, one more favor. I'm in need of medical supplies for my medical duty. I can't import them to Tarkov anymore, so I have to search for them here. It doesn't matter what you bring, supplies, drugs, stimulants. Anything will do. I'll be waiting."

Yeah, like some teenager, but that's actually working in your favor.\n\nWhy don't you go over there again and take a closer look? There's got to be more information in the journal about Ref, some dirt on him. Do that if you want to stop being expendable in the Arena.\n\nAnd one more thing: if you bring me any info on Ref that'll be worthy of my time, I'll pay you well."

That's why we need to think of a defensive plan now, because you and I are both going to get nailed!\n\nSo listen, I've got a plan all worked out. Except I don't have anybody else I'd trust to do something this complex. \n\nI was able to dig up some background intel on Skier. The kind of information that could compromise him real bad if it fell into the right hands. It's all in this letter, and it's our guarantee.\n\nYou need to pick it up at the customs area. The letter will be on the top floor of the building by the construction site. You know, the one near the railroad platform, you'll see it. Hopefully.\n\nFrom there, go straight to the reserve base and leave it in the headquarters on the third floor, at the fortified point with windows. \n\nThe key is to make sure that Skier's men don't intercept the letter. That is why after stashing the letter, run to Priozersk and make some noise. After you kill a couple of Scavs, go to the lighthouse peninsula and shoot a flare. You need a yellow one, don't get it mixed up!\n\nThe best place to do it is on the pier at the vacation houses and on the platform at the train station, it'll distract the guys from Skier's nearest base. After that, you run out of there! \n\nI've written all the instructions on a piece of paper to make sure you don't fuck it up. You gotta do it all at once, you understand?"

It was an quite an interesting challenge, let me tell you. But that's beside the point. \n\nHe hasn't been in touch for quite some time, and now he's suddenly asked for help. Apparently, something serious has happened. Can you check in with him and find out what's going on? There aren't many men of wit and ambition left in Tarkov. People like us should stick together."

Although, I'd likely shock some of the folks from my class myself.\n\nRecently, a certain guy from my school days reached out to me. After school, he went into the army, wanting to join the special forces... It was clear even then that he had a peculiar, uh, aptitude for that job.\n\nSomehow he found me here and asked me for a favor. He wants to remember his early years in basic training. I'm not a big fan of that sort of hospitality, plus I've got heaps of work to do. But let me put it this way: he was, um, very insistent. I don't need any more trouble, so I agreed to his deal, hoping you'd help me sort it all out.\n\nPeople say this kind of equipment used to be somewhat standard issue at his job: ORSIS T-5000, Vityaz and a Glock 17. All with the special mods, of course.\n\nThe rifle was equipped with an ATACR 7-35x56 34mm scope, Harris bipod, and a suppressor, I can't recall which exact one... Well, probably doesn't matter. Just get any suitable silencer, that'll work.\n\nFor Vityaz I need the Micro T-1 red dot with a spacer, Zenit RK-6 front grip and RK-3 pistol grip, PT-3 Klassika buttstock... I also need a PEQ-15, Klesch-2P flashlight, and, as you probably guessed, a suppressor, the standard Vityaz one.\n\nThe Glock is simple. You need to replace the barrel with the Double Diamond with their thread protector, add a Pachmayr Grip Glove, Klesch-2P flashlight, and a 21-round extendo mag. I think that's everything."
